#### here are some of my projects. (click on the name of the project for site/github link)
- [canvas](https://github.com/kussshhhh/canvas) : a "physical compiler" that transforms sketches and text prompts into 3D-printable models using AI. you can iterate on it and then and export as stl which you can 3d print :D demo: https://x.com/kucchi09/status/2010270871366316051?s=20

- [gazenet](https://github.com/kussshhhh/gazenet) : a gaze-controlled mouse that lets you control your computer's cursor with your eyes, using a webcam. it uses deeplearning models, mainly resnets and linear regression to map your gaze to screen coordinates.  
- [synapse](https://github.com/kussshhhh/synapse) : an "intelligent second brain" to store and search everything (images, URLs, notes) with AI, featuring semantic search and auto-tagging. it has many modes (semantic, text, both etc) 
- [golum](https://github.com/kussshhhh/golum) : (WIP) a minimal ml library in golang.
- [gyatt_form](https://github.com/kussshhhh/gyatt_form) : (WIP) a software that checks your workout forms(pushups, squats, etc) and counts your reps and corrects your form.

- [llama3.2 1b from scratch](https://github.com/kussshhhh/llama3-from-scratch) : implemented llama 3.2 1b model from scratch so basically most matrix muliplications except the tokenization. (inspired by naklecha in which he did it for the llama 3 8b model) 
- [gpt2 finetune](https://github.com/kussshhhh/ml/tree/main/mid_generation_func_calling) : finetuned gpt2 for function calling which makes it pretty good at math for certain operations
demo video and more explanation here: https://x.com/kucchi09/status/1936095566548664455
- [nodes](https://nodes-five.vercel.app/) : it generates a roadmap to learn the basics of any topic. 
	- click on a node to expand it. 
	- ask it questions related to that subtopic.
	- ~20k site visits
- [splitty](https://splitty-six.vercel.app/) : imagine splitwise but you dont have to manually enter details.
	- just upload a pic of your bill.
	- drag people to the things they share and its done.
	- can also run locally (using moondream) if you value privacy.
- [promptbox](https://github.com/kussshhhh/PromptBox) : an extension to store your prompts and it also comes with autocomplete. 
	- just store your prompts on a floating promptbox.
	- can be dragged around.
	- press tab to autocomplete, currently works really well with claude and chrome. 
- [raycaster](https://github.com/kussshhhh/raycaster) : a simple raycasting engine implemented using c and opengl. 
- [pixel_board](https://github.com/kussshhhh/pixel_board) : an infinite canvas/clipboard for dumping your memes and then reusing them.
    - it is a new way of storing images which reduces the upload time 
    - makes them very easy to find as you can just zoom out :D
